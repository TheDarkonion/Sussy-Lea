  <h1>Chapter 1, Episode 1 Sussy Stella</h1>
  <p>This Website is based on a girl named Stella. Stella is a friend of my sister. They are both very sus.</p>
  <p>My sister is called Lea. Lea and Stella have a really good friendship. They are both also very very pretty.</p>
  <p>I do have a few pictures of Stella and Lea, i am going to show a picture of Stella first:</p>
  <img src="susStella.jpeg" alt="HTML5 Icon">
  <p>To be honest... I am very proud of this picture i have taken.<br>This Picture Truely changed my life.<br>My vision has completely changed.
    Nothing will be like it was before. you are probably asking yourself: <br>
  "Why would someone be proud of a picture like that?!" <br>
It is because... Because no one has ever taken a picture of a Sussy baka.</p>
    <h1>Chapter 2, Episode 1 Sussy Lea.</h1>
    <p>what is there to say... I truely can not believe that my own sister, has turned into a sussy baka. <br>
      I mean... the friend of my sister? Yes. but my Sister? No. The fact that she is the most sussy person <br> 
      on earth. fortunately, there might be a way... To <br> SAVE <br> MY <br> SISTER!</p>
      <h1>Chapter 2, Episode 2: The rescue of my sister. </h1>
      <p>So, first of all: we do not know how sus my sister is. Because I can not describe it in words. <br>
      So, you have to see it yourself. Here it is:</p>
      <img src="susLea.jpeg" alt="HTML5 Icon">
      <p>WOW, WTF?! is probably what you are thinking right now.<br> trust me, i am thinking exactly the same. <br>
      Now, the most horrifying fact about my sister, is her opinion. <br> Yes, you heard me right. OPINION. <br>
    and you are probably thinking again "huh, how can a opinion be horrifying?! <br> 
  but trust me, it can.</p>
  <h1>Chapter 2, Episode 3: The opinion</h1>
  <p>She does not like Breaking bad. <br> "WTF!? HOW CAN A PERSON NOT LIKE THIS BEAUTIFUL SHOW?! <br> 
  is probably what you are thinking at this moment. And yes, i think that too. <br> 
I can not believe, what my sister has become. A sussy baka who does not like Breaking bad. <br> 
Wow... Just wow.</p>
<h1>Chapter 2, Episode 4: The rescue of my sister Part II</h1>
<p>As i have said, in the previous Episodes... I might know something, that could save her.. <br>
No, not only her. Also Stella. i know a Spell, that might work. But you might be asking yourself <br>
"WHAT!? a spell? have you gone crazy?!" So, now to anwser that question... Yes, a spell. <br>
And no, i have not gone crazy.</p>
<h1>Chapter 2, Episode 5: The spell</h1>
<p>The spell is an ongoing process. everyday, you can do one. <br>
   If you use one, it will get better. I have found the spell, in a Magic book. <br>
   Yes, a Magic book. I have bought it, from the web, of the web. The DarkWeb. <br>
   You heard me. "DarkWeb". <br>
    Now to the spell. "aUUTIUUADHAHDHHDJUIDIADKAMDKMXKjdsj <br>
  0(§"/"$")$)=787888**//----+0,,,,'ÄÖ:_:WHATHEFUCCKKK§ÜÜ**`?="GGG"!!!!CHLLOKKK;;;;::°OKKKK°$%&<br>CHILLL/()E@€€€OKKK(([[[[}}\IWI"
Now, you did not understand anything, did you? <br> There, you can hear it:</p>
